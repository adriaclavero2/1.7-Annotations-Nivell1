Task 7

Description

Learning project in Java to explore the behavior of annotations such as @Override and @Deprecated. The goal is to understand how annotations enrich the code by providing metadata that affects compilation and execution, and how they help enforce good practices or mark obsolete methods.

📌 Exercise Statement

Exercise 1 — Override

Create a hierarchy of objects with three classes: Worker, OnlineWorker, and PresencialWorker.
The class Worker has attributes name, surname, hourlyRate, and the method calculateSalary() that receives the number of hours worked and multiplies it by the hourly rate.
The subclasses must override this method using the @Override annotation.
In PresencialWorker, the salary is calculated as (hours * hourlyRate) + fuel, where fuel is a static attribute.
In OnlineWorker, the salary is calculated as (hours * hourlyRate) + INTERNET_FEE, where INTERNET_FEE is a constant.
From the main() method in the Main class, invoke the methods to demonstrate the effect of @Override.

Exercise 2 — Deprecated

Add some obsolete methods in the subclasses (OnlineWorker and PresencialWorker) and mark them with the @Deprecated annotation.
From an external class, invoke these deprecated methods.
Use the annotation @SuppressWarnings("deprecation") to suppress the warnings generated by the compiler.

✨ Features

Demonstration of @Override to ensure correct method overriding.
Demonstration of @Deprecated to mark obsolete methods.
Use of @SuppressWarnings to control compiler warnings.
Comparison between modern practices (annotations) and traditional coding without metadata.

🛠 Technologies

Java 21 or higher for implementing the exercises.
IntelliJ IDEA or any compatible IDE.

🚀 Installation and Execution

Clone the repository.
Compile and run in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE.
Execute the different main() methods (Main and the external class for deprecated methods).
Observe how annotations affect compilation and execution.

🧩 Diagrams and justification of technical decisions

Class hierarchy (Worker, OnlineWorker, PresencialWorker): demonstrates inheritance and method overriding.
Annotation @Override: ensures that the subclass methods correctly override the parent method.
Annotation @Deprecated: shows how to mark methods as obsolete, guiding developers to avoid their use.
Annotation @SuppressWarnings: illustrates how to manage compiler warnings when deprecated methods must still be invoked.
